# Get Help Using Entity Framework
## ![StackOverflow](../ef6/media/stackoverflow.png) Questions About Using EF  

The best way to get help using Entity Framework is to [post a question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) using the **entity-framework** tag.  

If you are not familiar with Stack Overflow, be sure to [read the guidelines on asking questions](http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking). In particular, do not use Stack Overflow to report bugs, ask roadmap questions, or suggest new features.  

## ![GitHub-Mark-32px](../ef6/media/github-mark-32px.png) Bug Reports and Feature Requests  

If you have found a bug that you think should be fixed, or have a feature you would like to see implemented.  

- For EF6 and earlier releases you can [report bugs and request features on our CodePlex project](https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic).  
- For EF7 and later releases you can [report bugs and request features on our GitHub project](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues).
