# Entity Framework No-Tracking Queries
Sometimes you may want to get entities back from a query but not have those entities be tracked by the context. This may result in better performance when querying for large numbers of entities in read-only scenarios. The techniques shown in this topic apply equally to models created with Code First and the EF Designer.  
  
A new extension method AsNoTracking allows any query to be run in this way. For example:  
  
```  
using (var context = new BloggingContext()) 
{ 
    // Query for all blogs without tracking them 
    var blogs1 = context.Blogs.AsNoTracking(); 
 
    // Query for some blogs without tracking them 
    var blogs2 = context.Blogs 
                        .Where(b => b.Name.Contains(".NET")) 
                        .AsNoTracking() 
                        .ToList(); 
}
```
