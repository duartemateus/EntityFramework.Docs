# Entity Framework (EF) Documentation
This page provides an index of videos, tutorials, and advanced documentation to help you make the most of Entity Framework. The following sections are included on this page.

## Get Started

[Which workflow should I use?](../ef6/entity-framework-development-workflows-video.md)  
Entity Framework allows you to create a model by writing code or using boxes and lines in the EF Designer. Both of these approaches can be used to target an existing database or create a new database. This short video explains the differences and how to find the one that is right for you.

### I just want to write code...

[I am creating a new database](../ef6/entity-framework-code-first-to-a-new-database.md)  
Use **Code First** to define your model in code and then generate a database.

[I need to access an existing database](../ef6/entity-framework-code-first-to-an-existing-database.md)  
Use **Code First** to create a code based model that maps to an existing database.

### I want to use a designer...

[I am creating a new database](../ef6/entity-framework-model-first.md)  
Use **Model First** to define your model using boxes and lines and then generate a database.
 	 
[I need to access an existing database](../ef6/entity-framework-database-first.md)  
Use **Database First** to create a boxes and lines model that maps to an existing database.


## Entity Framework Versions

This page provides information on the latest version of Entity Framework, although much of it also applies to past versions.
